Flow of Strandcast w/o asynchronous queue:

1. Coordinator starts
2. Subcoordinator starts
3. Peers start w/ individual processes each
4. Peers sign on to Coordinator 
5. Coordinator sends back peer available subcoordinator port information
6. Peer signs on to subcoordinator 
7. If peer has a next peer, ctrl server listens for subcoordinator information about next peer udp port 



Flow of Strandcast w/ asynchronous queue:


1. Coordinator starts 
2. Subcoordinator starts
3. peers start w/ individual processes each
4. (ON INIT SETUP) peers get queued in triples per subcoordinator
5. Given Peer queue with 3 peers gets popped and inserted into main array of peers associated with a subcoordinator
6. After peer gets inserted into main subcoordinator array, coordinator makes a call to peer with information on subcoordinator host and port
7. Peer signs on to subcoordinator with information sent to respective ctrl server
8. If peer has a next peer, ctrl server listens for subcoordinator information about next peer UDP port 
9. After all information is sent downstream, subcoordinator makes call to coordinator on send peers within its queue. Coordinator sends back length of queue for subcoordinator to keep track off
